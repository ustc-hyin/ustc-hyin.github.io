Our paper _Lifting the Veil on Visual Information Flow in MLLMs: Unlocking Pathways to Faster Inference_ has been accepted to <a href="https://cvpr.thecvf.com/">CVPR 2025</a>!<br>
This work investigates the internal visual information flow patterns in MLLMs and proposes a novel training-free inference acceleration method based on our findings.
