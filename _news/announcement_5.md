Our paper _The Mirage of Performance Gains: Why Contrastive Decoding Fails to Mitigate Object Hallucinations in MLLMs?_ has been accepted to <a href="https://neurips.cc/">NeurIPS 2025</a>!<br>
This work reveals that contrastive decoding fails to genuinely mitigate hallucinations. Any apparent improvements are merely artifacts of confounding factors, not true effectiveness.
