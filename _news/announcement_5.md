Our paper _The Mirage of Performance Gains: Why Contrastive Decoding Fails to Mitigate Object Hallucinations in MLLMs?_ has been accepted to <a href="https://neurips.cc/">NeurIPS 2025</a>!<br>
This work demonstrates that contrastive decoding does not genuinely mitigate hallucinations. Instead, any apparent improvements are attributable to misleading factors, rather than true effectiveness.
