**Research:** My research is primarily focused on multimodal large language models, with an emphasis on enhancing their efficiency and robustness. Specifically, I investigate methods for accelerating inference by pruning redundant tokens based on the internal patterns of information flow within MLLMs. I also explore architectural and algorithmic improvements, such as refined attention mechanisms and sampling strategies, to reduce object hallucination and improve grounding in visual inputs. Broadly, my work aims to develop generalizable methodologies for building more effective and reliable multimodal AI systems.

**Background:** I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn), advised by [Zilei Wang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zlwang/) in the [Vision and Multimedia Research Group](https://vim.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [China University of Mining and Technology](https://www.cumt.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Hu Shao](https://math.cumt.edu.cn/6d/ce/c9104a355790/pagem.htm).

<!-- **Previously:** I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon). I was a research intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), Uber ATG, and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml), [Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/), and [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php). -->
